Design 

- React-Hooks based state management strategy
    - redux-style centralized global store management
        - optional persistence management
- React-Hooks based API request module for components
- High Order Components based Auth Control

The whole webapp is splited into several parts:
    - app skeleton
        - responsible for page layouts & registering global styles/dependencies 
    - chart page 
    - login page 
    - table page
